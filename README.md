# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project 🏠

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! This project focuses on predicting house prices using multiple linear regression techniques. The project contains two Jupyter notebooks, each addressing different aspects of the analysis. Below you will find a detailed description of the project, including its objectives, data, and the methodologies used.

## 📁 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. The project uses a dataset with the following columns:

- **Area**: The total area of the house (in square feet).
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Main Road**: Whether the house is on the main road (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
- **Furniture Status**: The furnishing status of the house (Furnished, Semi-Furnished, Unfurnished).
- **Stories**: Number of stories in the house.

## 📝 Notebooks

This repository includes two well-documented and commented Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. **Multiple Linear Regression & Feature Selection**

This notebook explores multiple linear regression, including:

- **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)**: To check for multicollinearity among features.
- **P-value Analysis**: To determine the significance of each feature.
- **Model Building**: Detailed explanation of the model building process.

**Key Insights:**

- Identified significant features affecting house prices.
- Addressed multicollinearity issues using VIF.
- Evaluated the significance of features using p-values.

### 2. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**

This notebook focuses on feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):

- **RFE Method**: Utilizes RFE to select the most important features.
- **Model Training**: Demonstrates how to train a model with selected features.

**Key Insights:**

- Reduced the feature set to the most impactful variables.
- Improved model performance and interpretability.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is included in the repository and is structured as follows:

- **`housing.csv`**: The main dataset containing the features and target variable for house price prediction.

## 📚 Documentation

Each notebook is well-documented with detailed comments and explanations at every step. This will help you understand the thought process behind the analysis and the methodology used.

### **1. Multiple Linear Regression & Feature Selection**
- **VIF Analysis**: Checks for multicollinearity among features.
- **P-value Analysis**: Evaluates the significance of each feature.
